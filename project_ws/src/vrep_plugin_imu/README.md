# VREP_PLUGIN_IMU
## WHY SHOULD I USE IT
You need to publish imu infoes from VREP with **sensor_msgs/Imu** messages
## INSTALLATION
* clone the repository in your ros_package directory (e.g. ~/catkin_ws/src/ros_package/ )

  `cd catkin_ws/src/ros_packages`

  `git clone https://github.com/bartville/vrep_plugin_imu.git`

* compile the plugin

  `cd ~/catkin_ws`

  `catkin_make --pkg vrep_plugin_imu`

  it will generate a shared object in your devel/lib directory.

* Copy the generated library libv_repExtImu.so in your Vrep root

  `cp ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libv_repExtImu.so YOUR-VREP-ROOT-DIRECTORY`

* Launch roscore, then launch vrep, and check if Imu has been successfully loaded.

  Use the Imu model in the attached scene, Imu.ttt. (copy the whole model, accelerometer and gyro are in the tree)

* Start your simulation.

  ~~Praise the Sun.~~

  check if imu topic is publishing

  `rostopic echo /vrep/imu`
